# -chained-matrix-multiplication-algorithm


a program in VS C++ 2017 to implement the algorithm for the chained matrix multiplication problem shown in class. Your program should first prompt the user for the total number of matrices to be multiplied. It then asks the user to enter the dimension for each of the matrices. Your program then determines how the matrices should be parenthesized and displays the results to the screen (i.e.the M matrix, the P matrix, and the parenthesizationof the matrices). The following shows a scenario of running a sample program, where user's inputs are represented in boldface. You may assume all inputs entered are valid and the matrices to be multiplied are compatible.You may also assume the total number of matrices to be multiplied is 10 or less.> Enter the total number of matrices to be multiplied: 4> Enter the dimension forthe first matrix:5 2> Enter the dimension for the secondmatrix:2 3> Enter the dimension for the thirdmatrix:3 4> Enter the dimension for the fourthmatrix:4 6The following shows the M matrix and the P matrix computed, respectively.03064132024720720111233The following shows the optimal parenthesization of the matrices.(푀1((푀2푀3)푀4))
